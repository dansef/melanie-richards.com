Just a personal site, currently working on a redesign so things will look wonky for a bit. If you care to run this locally:

1. [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. Make sure you have [Ruby installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) on your machine.
3. Via the command line, navigate to the project.
4. Install Jekyll (and Jekyll pagination) by running `gem install jekyll` and `gem jekyll-paginate`.
5. Make any changes you'd like in the `_source` directory and run `jekyll build` from your command line.
6. From the project folder, run `jekyll serve`.
7. Visit `http://localhost:40000` in your browser.

Note: in an effort to 1) reduce binary file bloat and 2) avoid distributing stuff that shouldn't be distributed, there are a few things that will be missing in your local copy, such as fonts and images.
