Way back in September my (18×24 in.) poster design was added to [The Just Love Project](http://thejustloveproject.com/), which looks to raise money for children’s education and other basic needs. [Joshua Krohn](http://www.joshuakrohn.com/) charged us all to design something about love, so naturally I decided to go rogue and wax poetic about plants. You can still [buy the poster](http://thejustloveproject.bigcartel.com/product/the-just-love-project-september) in all its half-tone glory, or check out all the illustrations [at the upcoming show](http://thejustloveproject.com/blog/36143058450).
