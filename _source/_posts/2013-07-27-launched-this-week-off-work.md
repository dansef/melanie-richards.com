[Off-Work](http://off-work.com), a gallery of personal design work, launched this Tuesday. The site is [Ryan Hubbard's](http://ryanjhubbard.com/) brain-baby; he wanted to encourage himself and his friends to blow off creative steam on a regular basis. The illustrations also just *happen* to be sized for desktop backgrounds. We&rsquo;ve been working on O-W for too many moons than we care to admit, but it&rsquo;s awesome to see all those coffee-shop sessions come into fruition. I can&rsquo;t wait until there&rsquo;s more posts up on the site; with only one post per person, it appears to be a blog-style site, but each person actually has their own horizontal slideshow.

Fun observation from [Eileen Tjan](https://twitter.com/eileentjan): &ldquo;â€¦unintentional color scheme for first posts? ha. :D&rdquo; Yep, all our illustrations happened to be green, yellow, black, and white.

_This project was designed/conceived by Ryan, built by yours truly._
