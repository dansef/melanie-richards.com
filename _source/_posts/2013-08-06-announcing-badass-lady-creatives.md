I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that [Badass Lady Creatives](http://pinterest.com/BAladycreatives/boards/) is a thing that exists on the Internet! In the recent past there&rsquo;s been some drama about lack of female speakers and panelists at conferences in the creative/tech industries. What often goes unnoticed—and which I find more telling—are the small, pervasive ways in which praise, accolades, and respect are unevenly distributed.

The aim of [Badass Lady Creatives](https://twitter.com/baladycreatives) is to celebrate a wider set of talented individuals. It&rsquo;s not a fix-all—and there are other worthy topics, re: diversity—but it&rsquo;s a start. At this moment, there is a [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/BAladycreatives/boards/) account that will serve as a directory of actively-working creative women, and a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/baladycreatives) account that will share our favorite pins and news from said ladies. If these networks are not your thing, never fear: I/we are hoping to expand to other media, as well.

Speaking of we, I&rsquo;m so grateful to have some design-comrades curating this directory along with me. Many thanks to [Margot Harrington](http://pitchdesignunion.com/), [Joseph Hughes](text: http://www.northcoastzeitgeist.com/), [Dylan Lathrop](http://unequal-design.com/), [Helen Rice](http://fuzzco.com/), [Maria Rogal](http://mariarogal.com/), and [Stewart Scott-Curran](http://onlymoreneverless.com/) for coming on board with this project!

Parting thoughts:

* Though the first pins are very US/UK-centric, we plan to feature women on an international scope.
* Our definition of women is fluid. If you call yourself a lady, you are one.
* This is a merit-based project. Women will be featured because they are good at what they do.
