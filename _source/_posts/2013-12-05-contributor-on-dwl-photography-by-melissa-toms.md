Happy to announce that starting next Wednesday, I’ll be posting weekly on [Design Work Life](http://www.designworklife.com/2013/12/04/introducing-melanie/). My series is essentially an extension of [Badass Lady Creatives](http://baladycreatives.com/) (not-so-coincidentally, [that site](http://baladycreatives.com/) also launched yesterday), a project that I run which celebrates professional women in the creative industries. On DWL, I’ll be posting interviews, round-ups, badass women in history, and other lady creative news. It’s been interesting working from a social-media-first approach, but I’m so happy to have a permanent home for more robust posting.

I needed a landscape portrait for my posts on DWL, but having zilch—I tend to run away from the camera and/or make bizarre faces—[Melissa Toms](http://www.melissatoms.com/) and I held a quick portraiture sesh. She did such a great job and has such a warm personality that it was easy to relax.

Melissa is really great at event and food photography, often shooting with our mutual friend [Olivia Rae James](http://oliviaraejames.com/).

Melissa also shoots some really beautiful, moody photos:

Seriously, that looks like a painting.
