A couple of days ago I had the honor and pleasure to Skype with this year&rsquo;s senior class in the University of Florida Graphic Design program. Next month, these smart and talented students will present [Ligature 23](https://www.facebook.com/LigatureDesignSymposium), this year&rsquo;s installment of the student-run design symposium. If you find yourself in Gainesville, FL on February 7, you can see [Frank Chimero](http://frankchimero.com/) and [Kate Bingaman-Burt](http://katebingamanburt.com/) speak for free. Plus a gallery of hand-selected student work!

Anyway, the seniors asked me which blogs I read and which development resources I&rsquo;d recommend. I&rsquo;m actually working on a longer blog post series for the dev stuff, but here&rsquo;s a few links to get everyone started:

## A sampling of the blogs I follow:

* [Boxes and Arrows](http://boxesandarrows.com/): UX
* [BP&O](http://bpando.org/): Branding, Packaging, & Opinion
* [CSS Wizardry](http://csswizardry.com/): CSS best practices
* [Design Work Life](http://www.designworklife.com/)
* [Feature Shoot](http://www.featureshoot.com/): photography
* [Fast Co. Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/): there&rsquo;s so much of this that I usually just swipe through Feedly really fast to see which posts grab my attention
* [For Print Only](http://www.underconsideration.com/fpo/)
* [Kottke](http://kottke.org/): liberal arts
* [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/): THE WEB
* [Manhattan Nest](http://manhattan-nest.com/): hilarious home reno blog
* [MoCo Loco](http://mocoloco.com/): industrial/product design
* [Plenty of Colour](http://plentyofcolour.com/)
* [Remodelista](http://www.remodelista.com/): interior design
* [September Industry](http://www.septemberindustry.co.uk/): doesn&rsquo;t update much, but it&rsquo;s always really good stuff
* [Quipsologies](http://www.underconsideration.com/quipsologies/): assorted stuff

Those are the more general blogs; if I&rsquo;m into someone&rsquo;s work or the stuff they say on Twitter, I&rsquo;ll follow their personal blog as well.

## For learning web development:

* [24Ways](http://24ways.org/)
* [A Book Apart](http://www.abookapart.com/)
* [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/): check browser support
* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/): walkthroughs/exercises for several web languages
* [CSS Box Model explanation](http://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/)
* [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/): Chris Coyier knows the answer to any CSS question, possibly
* [Five Simple Steps](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/collections): lots of design manuals in there, too
* [SiteLeaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/): I recently interviewed [Jessica Harllee](http://jessicaharllee.com/), who built her portfolio site using the SiteLeaf CMS, and loved it.
* [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/)
* [Smashing Magazine](http://smashingmagazine.com/)
* [W3C](http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page): the guys that lead the internets. Not to be confused with W3Schools, which is [frowned upon](http://www.w3fools.com/).
* [Web Platform Docs](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page): The &ldquo;Beginners Guide&rdquo; has a lot of great info on web fundamentals

Two related tips: always check the date on blog posts with code examples in them. There may be more up-to-date information. And if you&rsquo;re the book-learning type, I&rsquo;d recommend eBooks over print books. Development changes so quickly, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to invest more money into something that will at some point be outdated and taking up physical space.

There&rsquo;s also a fledgling [resources page](http://baladycreatives.com/resources/) on my Badass Lady Creatives project. It&rsquo;s a bit sparse right now, but I&rsquo;m hoping to update that continuallyâ€”including a new category soon. One of the best links on there is [Jessica Hische&rsquo;s resources list](http://jessicahische.is/heretohelp). Also check out Jessica's personal projects and blog posts, because she is so incredibly generous with her knowledge. Even with [pricing](http://jessicahische.is/thinkingthoughtsaboutpricing).

Thanks again, guys! See you at Ligature.
