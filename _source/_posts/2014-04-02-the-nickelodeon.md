I&rsquo;m so excited to finally share this project: a new identity and website for [The Nickelodeon](http://nickelodeon.org/)! The Nick is an alternative/indie theater in Columbia, South Carolina. For an organization that has a huge influence on local culture, it was important to us to make this rebrand feel intelligent, fun, and a bit off-beat.

The &ldquo;About&rdquo; page is actually enormous, and it&rsquo;s one of my favorites, including the &ldquo;spine&rdquo; of staff bios. I&rsquo;ll spare you, though, and just [link to the full thing](http://nickelodeon.org/about).
