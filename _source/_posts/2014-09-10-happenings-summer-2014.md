So much has happened since I last updated my personal blog that I thought I'd scoop it all into one tidy post. Let's. Dive. In.

## A cross-country move

From one port city to another.

On the last day of June, I packed up all my things and moved nearly 3,000 miles across the country from Charleston, SC to Seattle, WA. I've had one eyeball on the Emerald City for a few years, and it felt like a good time to start a new adventure. I feel quite lucky to continue to work for the amazing people at Fuzzco.

Though I miss the guys and gals from back East (and Two Boroughs Larder ramen with shishito peppers), it feels really good to be here. And for those considering cold-moving to a new city, I'm thinking about a blog post detailing everything I've learned in the process.

I'm excited to be a part of the creative community in Seattle, so if you'd like to grab coffee/beer/boba tea sometime, let's do it! Email: mr[at]melanie-richards.com.

## Press for Badass Lady Creatives

A couple different bits of press for [Badass Lady Creatives](http://baladycreatives.com) all happened to make landfall around the same time: I was interviewed for CHARLIE&rsquo;s [50 Most Progressive](http://readcharlie.com/2014/05/28/13935/#.VA_fNWRdUu8), the July issue of [HOW magazine](http://www.nczeitgeist.com/writing/#/how-melanie-richards/), and the [Dribbble Timeout](http://blog.dribbble.com/post/87213273371/timeout-with-melanie-richards) series. Many thanks to the sweet people who gave me another forum in which to share BALC.

## Weapons of Mass Creation Fest

Oh my, this was a special conference. [WMC Fest](http://wmcfest.com/) is one of the most affordable conferences I've ever heard of, which may contribute to its refreshingly relaxed, friendly atmosphere (and Midwesterners really are that nice). I finally met some COMPLETELY RAD Twitter buds in person, and got to meet some great new people.

[Margot Harrington](http://pitchdesignunion.com/), [Stewart Scott-Curan](http://onlymoreneverless.com/), [Jeff Finley](http://www.jefffinley.org/), and the rest of the WMC Fest gang did a fantastic job putting this conference together. They prioritized a speaker lineup that better represents all the many perspectives our design community has to offer. Between a thoughtful speaker roster and the panels discussing race, gender, and the validity of &ldquo;do what you love&rdquo;, the tone of this conference was &ldquo;let's look out for each other, let's be good to each other&rdquo;.

## Working, working, working

Branding, illustration, and web design for The Green Heart Project.

Of course, this whole time I've also been working. While I can't show a lot of Fuzzco projects yet, [The Green Heart Project](http://greenheartsc.org) was one of my favorite clients to work with in 2014: Drew and Karalee are such enthusiastic, positive people. And designing for kids (and their parents) is such a fun challenge; I could spend days drawing wee veggies if no one stopped me. [View the live site](http://greenheartsc.org/)

## Interview on the Metis Blog

Semi-recently, the lovely House [interviewed me](http://www.thisismetis.com/blog/interview-designer-melanie-richards) for the Metis blog. It was fun to share a little bit about how I got into web design and front-end development, which might be helpful to beginning web creatives taking Metis&rsquo;s courses.

## A new site, sort of.

Though I still consider it temporary*, I did a little fussing with the site. For this version, I strayed from Typekit offerings in favor of [Brandon Text](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-text/) and Griffin Moore&rsquo;s [Range](https://okgriffin.com/range/). This is also the first time I&rsquo;m using [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/), a flat-file CMS. I had previously used Wordpress to power my site, but I felt the simplicity of a designer&rsquo;s portfolio/blog doesn&rsquo;t warrant the bloat of WP, or the load time spent making database requests (particularly when my host&rsquo;s MySQL server gets bogged down).

*\* Do as I say and not as I do, eh? Someday I will have a body of work up.*

&nbsp;

H&rsquo;okay, that&rsquo;s everything in life up to this point. Bring on the autumn!
