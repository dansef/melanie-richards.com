Comics are sort of design-related, and therefore relevant to this blog, right? Right.

Last week was [Short Run Seattle](http://www.shortrun.org/), a local festival celebrating comics, art, and small publishing. I've never actually had the privilege of living in a city with a comics fest (not to mention two, as there's also the Emerald City Comic Con, due in spring) so it was a real treat to attend talks and geek out at the book fair with a BUNCH of other people. I want to share the love for some old favorites and new-to-me local talent, so here's my haul:

Newest books from two comic artists I've followed for awhile: Yumi Sakugawa and Liz Prince.

Issues of the ever-free comics quarterly, The Intruder. Apparently these guys do some cool stuff in the comics community around town, as well.

The only non-comics book I bought. It's a mix of photos and poems–half of which are in Japanese, which I don't read–and what I suspect is magic. All by Yoshinori Henguchi.

If I had 3 wishes:

1. More $$$ so that I could have bought all the things.
2. There's a certain aesthetic to the stuff I walked away with; wish I had picked up a couple more of the "grotesque"-style stuff I was considering.
3. That the aisles were a little bit wider, as it got a little hard to navigate around popular tables. That being said, this is a fairly new festival so their venue options might be limited. And I've never been to a comics fest before, so, what do I know?

All in all, fantastic group of [exhibitors](http://www.shortrun.org/exhibitors/). So many awesome things to see that I think I even missed a couple (how did I miss [Mare Odomo](http://mareodomo.com/)'s table?!). Can't wait until next year!
