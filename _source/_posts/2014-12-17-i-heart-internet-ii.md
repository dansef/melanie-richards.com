* [10x2014](http://10x2014.tumblr.com), presumably redesigns of [Eric Mortensen](http://www.ericrmortensen.com) and [Richard Perez](http://www.skinnyships.com)'s favorite albums of 2014.
* [Aerial wallpapers](http://aerialwallpapers.tumblr.com), oooooh.
* I dig Dribbble profiles that read as a cohesive whole, but don't feel too expected. [BurntToast Creative](https://dribbble.com/BurntToast)'s work has a nice noodley quality to it.
* My mom is [always right](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/12/02/no-youre-not-sleeping-enough-and-its-a-big-problem-15-scary-facts-in-new-natgeo-doc/).
* Obsessed with [all these pins](http://prizepins.com/collections/all). I haven't seen enamel pins with loose linework before, pretty awesome.
*  [Meep](http://godspeedyoublacknerd.com/post/100072539171/justskippingalong-the-fade-to-black-oh-my-god-i), via [@beep](https://twitter.com/beep)
* [This little snakey](http://joyang.ca/artwork/year-of-the-snake/). Joy Ang's work hits some pretty special highs for me.
* If you ever get to design a flag, you're supposed to draw it in a 1.5 x 1 inch rectangle. I know some people who thumbnail this way with any illustration, but it's [particularly handy for flags](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/vexillonaire/).
* I always forget [this lossless image compressor](https://compressor.io) exists. I usually use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com), a desktop app.

## I've been sitting on these for a few weeks but whatever, still cool:

* Shopify did a great job updating their [checkout system](http://www.shopify.com/blog/15714308-introducing-responsive-checkout) for the responsive world. I've always been curious about how third party apps/platforms non-destructively update their product, and I like Shopify's solution: you can "opt-in" to the new responsive checkout (and downgrade if you wish), so if your no-longer-engaged developer wrote custom CSS for the legacy solution, your checkout won't look totally bonkers.
* This. Keyboard. Gif. App. [THIS KEYBOARD GIF APP!](http://blippy.com/)
* Happened to look at [these photos of Idaho](http://muffduff.com/journal/palouse) by Tyler Thompson while listening to [The Album Leaf](http://rd.io/x/QZ6DrDdNGkQ/), and I must say, it's a pretty chill mashup.
* [Turtle powerrrr](https://vine.co/v/OeAUB3raTlD)
* New-to-me ear candy: ["Reflections" by MisterWives](http://www.rdio.com/artist/MisterWives/album/Reflections/)
* The cover of [this playlist](https://designers.mx/mixes/rpheus) is so, so satisfying.
* [Yet another reason](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/11/helping-users-find-mobile-friendly-pages.html) to build mobile-friendly websites.
* Some nice [abstract gifs](http://mrdiv.tumblr.com/).
* Been waiting for this: you can now [search your own tweets](https://t.co/3ab934VfSg).
* Everyone loves the new [Beyoncé video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4YRWT_Aldo), right? Right. I love that she (or her team?) made something that feels very relatable / down-to-earth.
* Trying to figure out who built the new [Cinerama](http://www.cinerama.com/) site. The ticketing system—a custom job?—feels really smooth.
