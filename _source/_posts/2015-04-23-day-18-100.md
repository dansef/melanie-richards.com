*I am reading and taking notes on the HTML specifications for 100 days as part of #The100DayProject. [Read the initial intent/backstory](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/100-day-project). I am a Microsoft employee but all opinions, comments, etc on this site are my own. I do not speak on behalf of my employer, and thus no comments should be taken as representative of Microsoft's official opinion of the spec. Subsections not listed below were read without comment.*

Currently reading in [2.4 Common infrastructure, URLS](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#urls text: ).

## 2.5.1 Terminology

Some familiar stuff in this section, like if you don't specify a valid URL in an href attribute, you'll get a fallback of the document's URL.

## 2.5.2 Resolving URLs

Describes how to parse a relative URL (another-page.html) to an absolute URL (`http://example.com/another-page.html`). Though not stated in this section of the spec, it should be mentioned that not every URL needs to start with http:// or https://. These are just examples of protocols, which also include ftp://, file://, the newly proposed HTTP/2, etc.

Encoding is UTF-8.

## 2.5.3 Dynamic changes to base URLs

Any changes to the xml:base attribute or a document's base URL logically are applied to all descendants, elements in the document, etc.
