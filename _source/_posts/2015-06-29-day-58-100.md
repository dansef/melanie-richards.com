*I am reading and taking notes on the HTML specifications for 100 days as part of #The100DayProject. [Read the initial intent/backstory](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/100-day-project). I am a Microsoft employee but all opinions, comments, etc on this site are my own. I do not speak on behalf of my employer, and thus no comments should be taken as representative of Microsoft's official opinion of the spec. Subsections not listed below were read without comment.*

Currently reading in [4.2.6 Styling](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#styling)

“The `style` and `link` elements implement the LinkStyle interface.” When either is successfully processed (see spec for conditions), a `StyleSheet` object is returned with:

* **type**: actual type of the contents must match the type specified
* **location**: No location for `style` elements.
* **media**: Same as the `media` content attribute. An empty string if the attribute wasn’t specified.
* **title**: matches the `title` attribute, if given.
* **alternate flag**: for `link` elements. Boolean value for whether or not the `link` is an alternate stylesheet.

A stylesheet (`link`, `style`, or otherwise) can be considered script-blocking if they meet a few cumulative conditions, which appears to be the standard case. The UA gets to choose when to stop attempting to load a stylesheet.
