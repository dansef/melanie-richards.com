*I am reading and taking notes on the HTML specifications for 100 days as part of #The100DayProject. [Read the initial intent/backstory](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/100-day-project). I am a Microsoft employee but all opinions, comments, etc on this site are my own. I do not speak on behalf of my employer, and thus no comments should be taken as representative of Microsoft's official opinion of the spec. Subsections not listed below were read without comment.*

Currently reading in [4.4 Grouping content](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#grouping-content)

UAs = user agents = browsers and other HTML document parsers/renderers

## [4.4.11](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element) The figure element

“The `figure` element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained (like a complete sentence) and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.”

* Self-contained in this context simply means a complete thought, as opposed to an `article` that can be published independently, outside of the original content.
* Can contain [flow content](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#flow-content-1), followed or proceeded by *one* optional `fig caption` element.
* Use cases: marking up illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
* When writing content for the `figcaption`, provide identifying info that would allow you to move the 	`figure` element to any position or order in the document, rather than using relative labelling (“below”, for ex).
* “A `figure` element's contents are part of the surrounding flow.” So if the contents of the `figure` are only “tangentially related” to the content around it, you’d want to use an `aside` element, which could *in turn* wrap a `figure`.

## [4.4.12](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element) The figcaption element

No additional comments here.

## [4.4.13](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-div-element) The div element

Funny that one of the most common HTML elements has such a short stub of an writeup. I suppose that matches its semantic vagueness: “The `div` element has no special meaning at all.”

* “Authors are strongly encouraged to view the `div` element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable.”
* Where `div`s can come in handy, is by using `class`, `lang`, and `title` attributes to lend common styles and semantics to groupings of elements.

## [4.4.14](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-main-element) The main element

“The `main` element represents the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application.”

* No `article`, `aside`, `footer`, `header` or `nav` element ancestors allowed!
* Has no effect on document outline (which is not implemented in browsers anyway).
* Doesn’t contain content that appears site-wide; should just be content unique to this page.
* Only one `main` per page.
* UAs are encouraged:
   * to support keyboard nav to the `main` element.
   * Make the `main`’s first child element the next element to gain focus.
* Not intended to denote the main section of a subsection in the document.
* Should use ARIA `role=“main”` attribute on the `main` while we wait on UAs to implement the default role.

And that’s the end of 4.4 Grouping content!
