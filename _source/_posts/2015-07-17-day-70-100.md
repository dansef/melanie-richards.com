*I am reading and taking notes on the HTML specifications for 100 days as part of #The100DayProject. [Read the initial intent/backstory](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/100-day-project). I am a Microsoft employee but all opinions, comments, etc on this site are my own. I do not speak on behalf of my employer, and thus no comments should be taken as representative of Microsoft's official opinion of the spec. Subsections not listed below were read without comment.*

Currently reading in [4.5 Text-level semantics](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#text-level-semantics).

## [4.5.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-strong-element) The strong element

“The `strong` element represents strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents.”

* Nested `strong` elements increases “importance”.
* Using `strong` does not change a sentence’s meaning.

## [4.5.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-small-element) The small element

“The `small` element represents side comments such as small print.”

* Use cases: “disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights”, also licensing requirements or attribution
* Not to be used just to “de-emphasize” something: a very common mistake, I’d think.
* Only for short amounts of text.
* It could make semantic sense to wrap a `small` element in a `strong` element, which would be important fine print (“read the fine print!”).

## [4.5.5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-s-element) The s element

“The `s` element represents contents that are no longer accurate or no longer relevant.”

If you wanted to mark up a document edit that is a deletion, you’d use the `del` element instead.
