*I am reading and taking notes on the HTML specifications for 100 days as part of #The100DayProject. [Read the initial intent/backstory](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/100-day-project). I am a Microsoft employee but all opinions, comments, etc on this site are my own. I do not speak on behalf of my employer, and thus no comments should be taken as representative of Microsoft's official opinion of the spec. Subsections not listed below were read without comment.*

Currently reading in [4.5 Text-level semantics](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#text-level-semantics).

## [4.5.9](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-abbr-element) The abbr element

Probably I should have tried to get through this section [yesterday](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/day-71-of-100), as it can be tied in semantic meaning to the `dfn` element.

“The `abbr` element represents an abbreviation or acronym, optionally with its expansion.”

* The `title` attribute on `abbr` includes only its expansion: `<abbr title=“World Wide Web Consortium”>W3C</abbr>`.
* It’s okay to use the element w/o a `title` attribute to hook into some CSS styles. Only if it makes semantic sense (is actually an abbreviation/acronym), of course.
* A `title` attribute on one `abbr` element does not cascade to other `attr` elements in the document containing the same text value.

## 4.5.10 The data element

“The `data` element represents its contents, along with a machine-readable form of those contents in the value attribute.”

* The `value` attribute is required.
* Use cases:
  * Provide both a human-readable and a machine-readable format for information in one element. To be honest the only thing I could think of is a date with the ISO format on a `value` attribute, but in that case you’d be better off using the `time` element. Can anyone else think of an example?
  * As another way to provide info to scripts, similar to how developers use `data-*` attributes (those attributes feel more natural to me than using a `data` element, but ya never know, this could be more semantic in some contexts).

## [4.5.11](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element) The time element

“The `time` element represents its contents, along with a machine-readable form of those contents in the datetime attribute.”

* If you don’t set a `datetime` attribute, the `time` element can’t have any element descendents (loosey-goosey text ok).
* The `datetime` value has to match one of the syntaxes [listed in the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element).
