*I am reading and taking notes on the HTML specifications for 100 days as part of #The100DayProject. [Read the initial intent/backstory](http://melanie-richards.com/blog/100-day-project). I am a Microsoft employee but all opinions, comments, etc on this site are my own. I do not speak on behalf of my employer, and thus no comments should be taken as representative of Microsoft's official opinion of the spec. Subsections not listed below were read without comment.*

Currently reading in [4.5 Text-level semantics](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#text-level-semantics).

Fun fact: I have never used any of the elements in today’s reading.

## [4.5.20](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-mark-element) The mark element

“The `mark` element represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context.”

* Semantics inside a quotation: the HTML author is highlighting some text to give it more attention than the original source (“emphasis my own” type of deal).
* Semantics in main body content: highlighted text is relevant to the “user’s current activity”. I figured this would probably be text that changes given some interaction, and similarly the example in the spec is highlighting on text that matches an in-page search term.
* The `strong` element is for emphasis; the `mark` element is for relevance. A subtle difference.

## [4.5.21](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-ruby-element) The ruby element

“The `ruby` element allows one or more spans of phrasing content to be marked with ruby annotations.”

So…I was a bit confused at first because I thought this was referring to Ruby the programming language. Huh? Why does this particular programming language get its own element? But, oh:

“Ruby annotations are short runs of text presented alongside base text, primarily used in East Asian typography as a guide for pronunciation or to include other annotations. In Japanese, this form of typography is also known as *furigana*.”

Got it.

Which is fun because the programming language was created by Japanese developer Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. I suppose one could imply this is where the name comes from, but it doesn’t necessarily seem that way from a quick Wikipedia peek.

Anyway. This whole section is completely new to me and I’m not sure how to share notes without just rewriting the spec, so I’m going to take the cop-out method here and [link back to this section of the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-ruby-element).

## [4.5.22](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-rb-element) The rb element

One of the things that melted my brain in that last section on `ruby` was the omission of closing tags. It is ok to omit the end tag of `rb` if the element is “immediately followed by an `rb`, `rt`, `rtc` or `rp` element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.” Same general concept applies to `rt`, `rtc` or `rp` elements.

As for the definition: “the `rb` element marks the base text component of a ruby annotation.”

This element doesn’t have any semantic meaning on its own: it helps a parent `ruby` element decide what said `ruby` element represents. If that parent doesn’t exist, the `rb`’s representation is the same as its contents. Same general concept applies to `rt`, `rtc` or `rp` elements.

## [4.5.23](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-rt-element) The rt element

“The `rt` element marks the ruby text component of a ruby annotation.” The bits that give notation about the main `rb` text.

## [4.5.24](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-rtc-element) The rtc element

“The `rtc` element marks a ruby text container for ruby text components in a ruby annotation.”

The `rtc` element can be used for processing categorization of a `ruby` element’s content.

## 4.5.25 The rp element

“The `rp` element is used to provide fallback text to be shown by user agents that don't support ruby annotations.”

* Has to come immediately before or after an `rt` or `rtc`, but can’t be jammed between two `rt` elements.
* People often use the content of this element to put parentheses around the ruby text (`rt` elements), that bit which gives notation to the main text of the `ruby` element.
