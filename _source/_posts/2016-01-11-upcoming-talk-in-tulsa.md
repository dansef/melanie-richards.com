Quick announcement that I'll be giving my first talk next week! It's hosted by the Art Directors Club of Tulsa at Living Arts Center, Tulsa, OK, on January 21 (doors at 6:30, presentation at 7:30). In true weirdo-Melanie style, the talk is called "From Blerghing to Blogging: How to accidentally build a creative 'career' by rambling on the internet". I'll be discussing how a few simple posts have unexpectedly shaped my entire path thus far. I'll also share ideas on how and why you might approach your own blogging practice.

I have to admit I'm a bit nervous, but honored to have asked to come out to Oklahoma and excited to meet everyone! If you'd like to join in, up-to-date details for location, etc. can be found on the [ADC Tulsa website](http://www.artdirectorsoftulsa.org/homepage/melanie-richards).
