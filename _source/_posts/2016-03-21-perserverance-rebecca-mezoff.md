Came across a great idea from weaver [Rebecca Mezoff](http://rebeccamezoff.blogspot.com/2016/03/when-what-you-make-doesnt-feel-so-great.html) in my RSS feeds today:

> So if you're weaving your first set of tapestries and you aren't all that happy with what is coming off your loom, keep trying! Give yourself some credit for working at it. The practice will pay off. Notice what you love about the piece even if it is something as small as a specific color or yarn choice. Notice that thing you like and write it down. Use that bit of information in the next iteration.

I'd never thought of doing this before, but like all great ideas, it seems so obvious in hindsight. Instead of considering our lousiest projects as “failures” to be stored in a little box of shame and thus forgotten, we can make them work for us. No experience, then, is a loss.
