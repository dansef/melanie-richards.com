Visual update on the site today! There's some new projects in the works that I'm looking forward to sharing, but in the meantime, mostly just a fresh coat of paint around here. Chiefly because I got so sick of looking at the [bright orangey-pink bar](https://dribbble.com/shots/1720056-Minor-Redesign), with its less-than-accessible color contrast. If you'd like to test your color combos for legibility, [Lea Verou's contrast checker](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/) is a good tool that can help check flat color pairs.

Random notes about this update:

* I switched from [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If I'm choosing a CMS/templating engine for performance, I might as well go all-in on a static site generator (Kirby does some magic with PHP and text/image files in directories). So far enjoying it, though there's some features that I would consider "core" functionality that aren't quite there yet (pagination needs to be added via a plugin, for example).
* Left-aligning the page content?! Who have I become?
* I'll let you guess what the squares in the header are ;]
* In less fun news, I seem to have lost my Disqus comments. Looking to see if there's a way to restore. So if your previous comment is gone...we're still good.
* In the process of building the site, I tinkered around with my first experiments with client-side API requests. I ended up scrapping the idea I was working on, though I might do a post on it later. I've actually removed a couple working bells-and-whistles from the site; the honest truth is I prefer a simple portfolio site.

Forever making little tweaks, so if you find something weird, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/melanierichards/melanie-richards.com). Unless you're a current/former co-worker who likes to troll me for the lulzâ€”take your funny business elsewhere, good sirs.
