Hi, I'm Melanie Richards. I make mostly websites, mostly using design and code. Right now, I'm doing that on the [Microsoft Edge platform team](http://dev.microsoftedge.com). Most of my web projects help web developers understand where the browser is headed, and how they can use the features we've implemented. Before this, I worked on branding and web projects at [Fuzzco](http://fuzzco.com/), and was on the front-end team for a now-defunct music streaming service called Grooveshark. I live in Seattle, WA and am very much enamored with the Pacific NW (and my other home, the internet).

## Get in touch

The best way to say hi is at mr@melanie-richards.com, or <a href="http://twitter.com/somelaniesaid">@somelaniesaid</a> on Twitter. I work full-time, but I'm interested in the occasional moonlighting project or collaboration; [see my now page](/now) for details.
