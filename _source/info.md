# Hi, I'm Melanie Richards. I make mostly websites, mostly using design and code.

Right now, I'm doing that on the Microsoft Edge platform team. Most of my web projects help web developers understand where the browser is headed, and how they can use the features we've implemented. Before this, I worked on branding and web projects at Fuzzco, and was on the front-end team for a now-defunct music streaming service called Grooveshark. I live in Seattle, WA and am very much enamored with the Pacific NW (and my other home, the internet).

## Personal projects

* [Badass Lady Creatives](http://baladycreatives.com/): A blog I run that celebrates women in design and related fields.
* \#100DaysOfSpec: I read the HTML specifications for 100 commutes and learned a whole bunch.
* [Reading journal](https://github.com/melanierichards/reading-journal): I track the articles I read in design, development, and other stuff, so that others can enjoy them.
