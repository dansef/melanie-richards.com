## What I'm focused on right now

* Making internet on the [Microsoft Edge](http://dev.microsoftedge.com) browser platform team.
* Beefing up my JavaScript skills ðŸ’ª
* Discovering my style and approach to tapestry weaving.
* Enjoying the beauty of the Pacific NW. If you're in Seattle and want to grab coffee/beer/boba tea, [say hello!](mailto:hi@melanierichards.design)

## Moonlighting projects I'm interested in

I'm not actively looking for freelance client work at this time (though I'll make an exception for anything to do with nature, books and reading, or dogs!), but I am interested in the following:

* Just-for-fun collaborations.
* Open source contributions, and/or sites for social good, especially in the Puget Sound area.
